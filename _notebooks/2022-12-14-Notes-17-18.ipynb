    "* In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let's call this algorithm HaltChecker.\n",
    "* HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of \"halts\". If progra*m P doesn't halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of \"never\". For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of never.\n",
    "* Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker's output. So, if \"never\" is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is halts. It's also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of \"halts\", then Reverser has an output of never.\n",
    "* We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code.\n",
    "* Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints \"never\" when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints \"halts\" when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem."
