    "This code simulates the motion of the ball using the equations of motion for projectile motion. It starts the ball at the left field (x = 0), and simulates its motion by updating its position at each time step using the initial velocity components and the acceleration due to gravity. The loop continues until the ball reaches home plate (x > 100), at which point the simulation stops and the final position of the ball is printed. It uses a physics equation to see where the ball will be thrown based on the angle and speed of the ball."
