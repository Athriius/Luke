    "* Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language.\n",
    "* Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called.\n",
    "* A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called.\n",

    "# Calling Procedures Cont.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When calling procedures, it's important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements.\n",
    "* If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments.\n",
    "* If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable\n",
