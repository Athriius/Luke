## 1st Video Scoring

| Row | Student Score | College Board Score | Explanation |
| 1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | The video showcases a place for the user to put an input after the rock/paper/scissors question. It shows functionality by showing it having an output in response to a specific input. Describes purpose of the program as "to make a decision" which can be done via its random element. Descrives how the computer chooses either rock, paper or scissors and then compares to the users input to determine an output.|
| 2 | 1/1 | 0/1 | The writing shows data stored in a list of the three options. The second code segment shows how the users input is used and compared to a computer decision, both of these decisions comparing different options from data stored in the list. RPS represents the list. Describes data as potential options |
| 3 |  0/1 | 0/1 | A code segment is included, but the list is not being used to manage complexity. |
| 4 | 0/1 | | 0/1 | No additional code segements are included. Describes how to code works but does not refer to a specific code sgment. |
| 5 | 1/1 | 1/1 | The student algorithm has sequencing in rpsGame, selection in conditionals based on variables in the list, and iteration by going through all of the options to decide an output. |
| 6 | 1/1 | 1/1 | Two calls in the procedure are described along with their function. Describes how the condition of input being either rock or paper is tested against the computer decision. |
