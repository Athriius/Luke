## 1st Video Scoring

| Row | Student Score | College Board Score | Explanation |
| 1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | The video showcases a place for the user to put an input after the rock/paper/scissors question. It shows functionality by showing it having an output in response to a specific input. Describes purpose of the program as "to make a decision" which can be done via its random element. Descrives how the computer chooses either rock, paper or scissors and then compares to the users input to determine an output.|
| 2 | 1/1 | 0/1 | The writing shows data stored in a list of the three options. The second code segment shows how the users input is used and compared to a computer decision, both of these decisions comparing different options from data stored in the list. RPS represents the list. Describes data as potential options |
| 3 |  0/1 | 0/1 | A code segment is included, but the list is not being used to manage complexity. |
| 4 | 0/1 | 0/1 | No additional code segements are included. Describes how to code works but does not refer to a specific code sgment. |
| 5 | 1/1 | 1/1 | The student algorithm has sequencing in rpsGame, selection in conditionals based on variables in the list, and iteration by going through all of the options to decide an output. |
| 6 | 1/1 | 1/1 | Two calls in the procedure are described along with their function. Describes how the condition of input being either rock or paper is tested against the computer decision. |

## 2nd Video Scoring

| Row | Student Score | College Board Score | Explanation |
| 1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | Video shows input: guessing a letter, program functionality: only a single letter can be entered, and output: a correct letter will appear on screen while an incorrect letter will cause the life counter to go down. Written response describes purpose: to learn new words and describes the program's functionality.
| 2 | 1/1 | 1/1 | Includes two code segments showing data collection and that data being used. Uses a random word function to generate words which are then chosen with a parameter which selects words with only 5 letters of length. |
| 3 | 1/1 | 1/1 | Uses the letOfGuessWord is used to replace running 5 seperate variables for each letter which would be less efficient. 
| 4 | 1/1 | 1/1 | The first code segment shows the paramaters for a letter being incorrect if check=false. The segment also shows how the code works by subracting lives when an input does not match the correct letter and displaying the letter when the input is correct. |
| 5 | 1/1 | 1/1 | The students guessword function contains sequencing, selection with boolean values and if statement, and iteration with a for loop. Explains how the if statement in the for loop is used to set a letter as true. |
| 6 | 1/1 | 1/1 | Two calls are described in the written response. The first call describes what happens in the for loop if the input is incorrect, causing the input to not be found in the random word. The second call describes what happens if the for loop is correct. |

## 3rd Video Scoring

| Row | Student Score | College Board Score | Explanation |
| 1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | The video shows a state being inputed causing the program to go to a new page which displays outputs about state info depending on which state was clicked. The purpose is described as giving info about the states and the functionality is described in the written response. |
| 2 | 0/1 | 0/1 | Code segments are shown, but it does not show data from a list being used. |
| 3 | 0/1 | 0/1 | Code segments are shown, but again there is no data from a list being used. |
| 4 | 1/1 | 0/1 | Shows a code segment including a procedure with information on all the states and a sefment where it is called. |
| 5 | 0/1 | 0/1 | The response code includes sequencing with updateScreen and selection with if statements but does not include any kind of iteration. |
| 6 | 0/1 | 0/1 | Response describes operations performed by the user and not any actual paramaters being called. |

# 4th Video Scoring

| Row | Student Score | College Board Score | Explanation |
| 1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | Video demonstrates program running with purpose being to "lessen boredom." The a and d keys are shown to be the input and the boat's movement is the output. |
| 2 | 1/1 | 1/1 | Two code segments are shown one of which shows code from the list fishysegments being used. |
| 3 | 1/1 | 1/1 | The list mentions manages complexity storing number of fish and type of fish caught. |
| 4 | 1/1 | 1/1 | The student developed algorithm clone+movement+range uses 5 parameters. |
| 5 | 1/1 | 1/1 | The algorithm includes sequencing, selection in an if statement, and iteration in a for loop. |
| 6 | 0/1 | 0/1 | Arguments were not described passing through parameters. |
