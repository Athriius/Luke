## KASM

1. A Virtual desktop allows you to access a complete desktop environment hosted on a remote server or through cloud infrastructure. KASM is a cloud-based virtual desktop platform that is designed for security-sensitive environments. It is able to do things like hardware-based security and encrypted data storage. For the purposes of our class, virtual desktops like KASM can be used to provide students with computing environment that is secure and reliable regardless of the hardware and software available on their own machines.

## Duck DNS and AWS Hacks

Part 1:

Part 2: Duck DNS is a very impotant part of internet infrastructure that translates human-readable domain names like www.yahoo.com into IP addresses that computers can use. We use DNS to access websites, send emails, and connect to other online services. DNS allows us to have practical domain names and eliminates the need to remember IP addresses.

DuckDNS is a free dynamic DNS service that allows users to assign a custom domain name to their public IP address, making it easier to access their home network devices remotely. It works by running a client script on a device connected to the network that periodically sends the current IP address to DuckDNS servers, which then update the DNS record with the new IP address. DuckDNS is unique in that it does not require users to register or provide any personal information to use the service, and it supports multiple subdomains per account.

DuckDNS is useful for our projects because it enables us to access our home network devices remotely without having to remember the IP address or perform complex configurations. We can use DuckDNS to access our Raspberry Pi servers, cameras, and other IoT devices securely and conveniently from anywhere in the world.

### Here is how you set up Duck DNS in a few steps:

1. Go to the DuckDNS website and sign up for an account.
2. Choose a custom subdomain name for your account.
3. Install the DuckDNS client script on a device connected to your network.
4. Configure the client script to run periodically and send the current IP address to the DuckDNS servers.
5. Update your routerâ€™s port forwarding settings to forward traffic to the appropriate device on your network.
6. Test your setup by accessing your custom domain name from a remote location.

Part 4: Nginx/Docker has an old command called "docker run" command that should be changed because it's been replaced with "docker container run". Also, watch out for those outdated configurations because they might be using weak SSL protocols and ciphers that could mess with your security. It's a good idea to update them to use modern and secure options.
