# Idea

Ok bro. So. Here is what we are doing. I feel like what we should do is make a chat forum website. Make it so each user can only input one post each day and people can vote on posts. Dont include a login system. all posts anonymous. People can vote on what posts are good and what posts are bad.

# New Idea:

Dont make it one post per day. That seems stupid. Instead. AMOGUS Chatroom. If a poster types the word AMOGUS anywhere in their post the website will create a post with various sus statements.
