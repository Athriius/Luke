# Our Scrum Team

Arnav, Tay, Adi and I are highly focused on planning and sharing ideas within our team to ensure that our knowledge is not limited to any one member. We place a large emphasis on the brainstorming aspect of sprint planning. Tay oversees productivity and helps make sure that we are all collaborating in our work. He works with me to do backend development while Adi and Arnav work on the frontend.
