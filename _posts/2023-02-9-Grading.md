# Me Grading Abdullah: 0/1
Abdullah has some basic work done for his project. There is a limited amount of Javascript for the beginnings of an asteroid game as well as image assets he has prepared to use in the game. Presently he is not able to display it but there are sections of his code that would function if he could.

# Abdullah Grading Me
Today, Luke Angelini showed me his project for a movie review site. He has done frontend and the home-page is mostly complete. While submissions cannot be made at the time, it still shows that he can.
He was honest on the project's shortcomings, and proved that he could do what his project was.
However, as it doesn't work properly, it must have a 0/1.
0/1
