## Highlights from Collegeboard Videos:

# Chat GPT Talk
* Chat GPT can give you answers to basic things you ask it. Math Homework, Coding, Recipes Etc.
* Chat GPT owned by OpenAI, which in turn is owned by Microsoft.
* Disruptive techs: change how humans go about daily life.
* Searches the internet in a streamlined manner.
* is a power potent version of Google which stops us from having to critically think to get our solutions.
* Chat GPT is biased to whatever the majority answer is on a topic. Gives the same answer because it decides algorithmically.

Personally I think it's a bit unfortunate that artist's work is being used to create this AI artwork. However, I don't think banning this is a solution that makes sense as things like this are already being done on a smaller scale by people anyways. It's a bit of a moot point. I think ultimately the benefits of speeding up the information acquisition process will probably outweight the cons of both it existing and what it would be like to try and get rid of it.

# Digital Divide Talk
* Divide between have and have not
* Here at Del Norte we all have computers as a matter of policy, whereas poorer communities do not.
* Large companies would have better servers to run their code, better devices, more kinds of updated software available and other benefits like that.
* Viasat (Satellite Broad-Band Services): Try to give internet infrastructure to areas of the world without ground based systems. Helps to close the digital divide in places without traditional infrastructure.
