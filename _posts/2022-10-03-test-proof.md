# Challenges: Week 6

I wasn't exactly sure what some of the syntax meant. This problem was especially apparent in the word problems and the last quiz in general where I wasn't exactly sure what the desired effects were for the questions about the mobile application and also what some of the problems with example syntax were doing.


# Challenges: Week 7

For the last question on the correcting errors quiz I didn't realize that there was nothing to account for numbers lower than 7 in the problem and I got confused thinking that because there wasnt a >= with the 7 that it would be some kind of error. As for the internet quiz I was mostly confused about some of the vocabulary and the subject matter.
