## Notes

Large companies need to work together to create things
Ex. Facebook has to manage multiple departments for multiple apps
Computing innovation: Includes a program has an integral part of its function
Computing innovation can be physical(Oculus), nonphysical software(Facebook), or a nonphysical concept(advertising on social media)
People can work together to develop computing innovations
It helps to have diverse backgrounds in each teammate, and this will help in creating quality programs.
Important to: Communicate, Get a Consensus, Negotiate, Resolve Conflicts
Pair programming: Two programmers working together in a pair. One person writes the code, while the other reviews the code
Think-Pair-Share: Students think on their own, then pair up to share ideas, and then share with the class
Leaving comments on code help partners see what you are doing, and help you stay oriented.
Also use comments to cite sources in your code.


## My Scrum Team

Tay, Arnav, and Aditya are my current scrum team parters. We don't really have any prior connections or common interests. We are diverse in our backgrounds and perpectives. We come from various grade levels, which is part of our different backgrounds. Our group will succeed in the classroom, as we are hard workers, we collaborate frequently, and we are willing to put in the effort to learn.
