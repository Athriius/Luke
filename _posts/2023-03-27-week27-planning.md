# Reviewing Results

## Problem 4: 
In which of the following situations would it be most appropriate to choose lossy compression over lossless compression?

I put B "Storing a formatted text to be restored to its original version for print publication." I chose this answer since I just assumed that text would be the best since it is the simplest form of media listed. I failed to recognize that specifically formatted text would be best to keep in its original format, and thus prefer lossless compression.

The correct answer was C "Storing music files on a smartphone in order to maximize the number of songs that can be stored." This is because the key factore was to minimize storage space used and so lossy compression is better to use space as efficiently as possible.

## Problem 21:
Assume that applying either of the filters will not change the relative order of the rows remaining in the spreadsheet.

Which of the following sequences of steps can be used to identify the desired entry?

Select two answers.

Here I put B "Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year" which was correct, and C "Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer" Which was incorrect. C wasa incorrect because I failed to take into account that it would not filter out entries with an unknown year.

The correct answer was D, because it would've filtered for that unknown year.

# CPT Planning

As for my CPT project, I currently am working on creating the framework for my backend so that I can store the data of posts. I am using the user API that we practiced with in the last few weeks as the basis for my own class which I'll be using to store data about movie reviews for my website.
