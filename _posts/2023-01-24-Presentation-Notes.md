## Presentation Notes

# Goals
* Allow clud execs to confirm clubs
* Allow club leaders to add information about clubs

# Features
* Only clubs with accounts can update their information
* Admins would be executive of clubs at school who could edit info for any clubs
* Uses a table to list all clubs on campus.
* Club Review Database: Database for each club where students can put in reviews and makes it so admins can delete roles. There would be a page for each club which would contain multiple reviews.
* Clubs have to normally log meeting minutes and other info in person. Database could be used to update this info via a centralized website.
* Decided to add a search feature where you can search a topic of a club to see all clubs related to that topic.

# Challenges
* How to send a file into the backend into the database table

# Functionality
* Using spring for backend and github fastpages as frontend
* Frontend has name and date of person logging in which then gets added to the backend table

## Teamwork Notes

* Uses a series of documents with group goals.
* Team has a scrumboard to keep track of what they have done and what they will do each week.
* Uses a group manifesto to determine agreed upon group behavior
