Can put things that entice you specifically and appeal to your vices when you otherwise wouldn't have that</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-HP-Computer-Racist?">Is the HP Computer Racist?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Is-the-HP-Computer-Racist?"> </a></h1><p>I don't think that the designers of the computers were racist. I can imagine that they aren't exactly thorough testers, but not racist. Mostly I think it is ignorance on the testers part as they probably aren't black and so when they were testing they weren't able to get any testing done with black faces meaning the software doesnt recognize the significantly different facial features.</p>

<p>For my project specifically I could create a survey about potential features for a chat website and also phrases to use for the random aspect. I could possibly collect random phrases and add them to the API.</p>
