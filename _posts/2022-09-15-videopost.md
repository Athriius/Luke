## Notes from the video

* Stress: a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or very demanding circumstances
* Stress is prominent in many places
* Getting a good thing happen on one day usually does not change our happiness multiple months down the road, so we should try to implement small changes in our life everyday.
* Just because we know something, it does not mean it will benefit us unless we put it into practice.
* Need to do different things, like how people do different exercises in the gym.
* While we need a decent amount of material possessions(money, food, clothing, etc.), at a certain point, having bigger and better does not improve happiness levels.
* Make social connection
* Social connection: the feeling that you belong to a group and generally feel close to other people
* Important to make time to spend with friends and family away from homework.
* Help others
* Helping others can help us by making us feel good about ourselves
* Treat yourself
* No matter how you treat yourself for accomplishments, you can gain important benefits.
* Make time for gratitude
* Show gratitude for your situation and the other people around you who help you.

## Gratitude

Gratitude helps to keep us grounded. It helps us to ensure we remember all of the positive sides of life that sometimes become clouded through our ambition or stress.

As for things I am grateful for, I would say there are a few. The biggest are my family and my close friends, in both cases I have been blessed to have been given loving and appreciative individuals who want to help me succeed. I am also very grateful for the place in middle class society that I have been born into with all its benefits such as easy access to food, shelter, and devices like the computer I am typing with right now. And finally I would say I am grateful for the staff of this school for doing such a great job in helping me to learn.

My experience with a note of gratitude: I gave my note of gratitude to my dad. He was a bit surprised upon hearing it, and he seemed very pleased with what I had told him.

Goals
Goals can help an individual feel a sense of progress. I think goals are great ways to divide up tasks, which can lead to less stress. When creating goals, I like to have more specific goals.

My Personal Goals:

* Work on homework before the night before it's due
* Sleep for at least 8 hours each night
* Try and put in an extra hour each day on some school or personal project

Goals can help us feel more organized, even we have a lot on our plate. This will help reduce stress levels in us. Especially with college application season, I think creating a list of small and specific goals related to applications will allow me to be less stressed, feel more in control, and be happier.
