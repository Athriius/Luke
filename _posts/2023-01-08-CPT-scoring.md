## My Scoring

# CPT 1:

* Row 1: I think this response earned the point for this row because it showed and described the input for the function as being 3 sides of a triangle and showed the functionality and output of giving trigonometric values.

* Row 2: I think they earned the point for row 2 because two code segments are provided in the written section which show data storage and how it is used.

* Row 3: I would not give the point for row 3 because their explanation about the importance of the lists isn't exactly correct. This is because the list could be replaced by return statements and strings and have the same effect

* Row 4: I would give the point here. There are two code segments, one with a student developed procedure, ratioCalculate, and one showing that procedure being called. The response also describes the procedure and how it contributes to the whole of the code by calculating the side ratios.

* Row 5: I think they would earn the point for row 5. The code segment showed includes sequencing, selection with an if statement, and iteration with for in a range loop. There is also a full description of how the code works in enough detail to recreate it.

* Row 6: I think that they would earn the point for row 6. The written portion describes how ratioCalculate is used for two calls. the first checks that the inputs cannot be simplified and the second checks to make sure there are no remainders. Finally, the response shows the results of each call: 3:4:5 and 12:23:34

Final Grade: 5/6

# Reviewing my Grading: CPT 1

After looking at the collegeboard grading example I think my analysis was mostly accurate and pretty similar to that of Collegeboard. However, I failed to realize in row 2 that there was a large difference between describing project function and showing the output that the project submitted missed. In hindsight it makes sense they wouldn't earn the point for that category because there is no clear description for the project's function.

# CPT 2

* Row 1: They would earn the point for this row. The video shows the programs function by placing tiles on a grid and them expanding based on principles from "Conway's Game of Life." The written response describes the purpose to entertain as well as the inputs of space, p, r and mouse clicks, as well as the output of filling the cells.

* Row 2: The project would earn a point for this row. Two code segments are provided, one with the list startGrid. There are also extra lists used. The response states that stored in the list is the data for the 120x90 field of cells.

* Row 3: The project would earn a point for this row. Code shows a list being used to access and store the status of each of the cells. The written response describes how to try and store the data of each cell in a 120x90 list without using that list would far too difficult and waste time.

* Row 4: They would earn a point for this row. The response includes code with a student developed procedure replaceList and also shows the procedure being called. The written portion describes the procedures function and how it replaces the values from one list with the values from another.

* Row 5: They would earn the point here. Their replaceList procedure includes sequencing, selection with an if statement, and iteration with a repeat loop.

* Row 6: The project would earn a point for this row. It describes two calls to the procedure with two sets of current and replacement values. The written portion then describes the conditions being tested and how they the values will be replaced.

Final Grade 6/6

# Reviewing my Grading: CPT 2

Overall I think I had pretty much the same analysis as collegeboard here and had all of the points down.
