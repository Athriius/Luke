## Prelude

Overall this tri has been a very educational first look into coding more broadly for me. I started out my interest in the subject with a very basic youtube Python tutorial and have come out of this trimester using not only Python but also HTML and javascript and making programs using APIs and AWS. It has been a very quick experience but I have also learned a lot in this short bit of time. 

As for the final itself it mostly went over some program fundamentals we learned while working with the code as well as some principles of coding in a team and what an application should do.

## The Quiz Itself

As for my performance on the quiz I feel I did pretty good. I had a bit of an issue with some of the more complicated questions about the code but given my score I think I had pretty good comprehension of most of the basic coding principles and the other topics included in the final as well.
