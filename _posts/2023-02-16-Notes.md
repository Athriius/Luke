## Notes

- Connecting to the wifi: Protocol is called Dynamic Hotspot Control Protocol?? Definitely called DHCP. 
- When running website the first point we connect to is the URL for the frontend
- Domain name refers to IP address which are numbers.
- When you type in your browser with your domain name it will do a DNS lookup.
- Fetch always has URL which talks to another server. In frontend gives HTML
- Fetch in the backend gives JSON.
